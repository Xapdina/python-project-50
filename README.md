### Project: Difference Calculator

Difference Calculator is a tool for comparing two files of different formats (e.g., JSON or YAML) and
displaying the differences between them in a convenient format. It allows identifying changes in the data structure,
added or deleted elements, as well as modifications in the values of fields. The project supports various output
formatting styles, such as "stylish," "plain," and "JSON," for presenting the comparison results.
